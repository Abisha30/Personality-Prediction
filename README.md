                                                           PERSONALITY PREDICTION
Abstract:
                
    Personality of a person plays a crucial role in the organizational progress and also in the self-development process in an individual’s life. 
    One of the typical ways to predict the person’s personality is either by a standard review or by scrutinizing the Curriculum Vitae of the candidate. 
    In this project, a system that automates the task of segregating candidates based on eligibility criteria and personality evaluation in a recruitment 
    process is proposed.
    Companies typically receive thousands of applications per job opening and have a dedicated team of screeners to select qualified candidates. 
    It is very difficult for human to manually go through the cv of all applicants. 
    Many candidates get filtered out in the first round itself on the basis of suitability, improper CV, not being skilled enough.
    To meet this requirement an online application is developed for the registration of candidate’s details and analysis of candidate’s personalities through
    an online SKILL TEST containing personality quizzes.

Proposed System:
     
     In this project, SKILL TEST are available for aptitude, technical languages like C, C++ and the marks are also predefined for all these
     questions and if the candidates score high marks in that they will be selected for that job role and will be hired.
     Second advantage is that there is zoom meeting available for both the candidate and the HR .
